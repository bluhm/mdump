# mdump

This is a tool to interpet and show information by experimental changes to OpenBSD's `malloc`.
`mdump` needs a trace file generated by runnig your program with

```
MALLOC_OPTIONS=DT ktrace -tu program
```

To get deeper stack trace information on leaks use more `T`'s

Basic usage is
```
  mdump
```
to show leak info and
```
  mdump -D
```
to show a dump of malloc's internal state at program exit.
