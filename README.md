# mdump

This is a tool to interpet and show information generated b y my experimental
changes to OpenBSD's `malloc`. At the moment of writing these changes have not
been published.
`mdump` needs a trace file generated by running your program with

```
MALLOC_OPTIONS=DT ktrace -tu program
```

rmmeber to build your program and libraries with debug information.
On OpenBSD system libraries are installed with debug info, so that's
convenient.  To get deeper stack trace information on leaks use
more `T`'s. Note tha the machanism used (`builtin_return_address`)
is not guaranteed to work for more than one `T`, some executablea
on some platforms s will crash when too many `T`'s are used.

Basic usage is
```
  mdump
```
to show leak info and
```
  mdump -D
```
to show a dump of malloc's internal state at program exit.
